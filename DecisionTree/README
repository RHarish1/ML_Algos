# Decision Tree Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a decision tree classifier using Python. Decision trees are a popular method for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the class label of a given set of features.

## Features

- **Node Class**: Defines the structure of each node in the decision tree.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Calculates entropy for a set of labels, which is used to measure the impurity of a dataset.
- **Information Gain Calculation**: Computes the information gain for each feature to determine the best split.
- **Decision Tree Building**: Builds a decision tree recursively based on the information gain of features.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the decision tree using the `pydotplus` library.

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn pydotplus
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RHarish1/ML_Algos/tree/main/DecisionTree
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd decision-tree-implementation
   ```

4. Run the Python script:

   ```
   python decision_tree.py
   ```
